WORKING TITLE: ANACONDA: SERPENT'S REVENGE

This is a game I have put together based on the classic original Snake game...

It's mostly written in vanilla javascript and it takes advantage of both the html <canvas> tag
and html document object model (dom)

It uses simple keyboard arrow controls to direct the snake around the canvas in the hope of picking up food.

A simple scoring system is implemented.
